# lgogdownloader-fedora

This repository contains the files required for building an RPM package of [lgogdownloader](https://github.com/Sude-/lgogdownloader). Pretty much everything in this repo has been forked from [scx's COPR repo](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/scx/lgogdownloader/). However, whereas scx's COPR repo only provides v3.4 of lgogdownloader, this repository enables you to build v3.6 as well.

To directly install lgogdownloader (instead of compiling it yourself), you can use [this COPR repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ruub/lgogdownloader/) instead.

_Note: Currently only Fedora 30 and 31 are supported._
